# super-notes

My personal opensource note-taking web application for developers using Firebase. Made for preventing the use of cookies. Everyone who builds their free Firebase database can create their own note-taking application by forking this code. 

Demo user for this application will be active soon! 

Notes can be arcived, or recycled. They can be highlighted if important, or seperated into groups using the tagging system. 

This project is implemented with the help of my team from Koza Yazılım, where I am working as an intern.
